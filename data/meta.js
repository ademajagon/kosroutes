Booleden (15km) starts at Boo Hembygsg√•rd in Orminge and leads to Str√∂mmen on the border to V√§rmd√∂, where the V√§rmd√∂leden takes over (25k). They are both marked with orange stripes on trees or poles. Do not miss the breathtaking view from Himlaberget (70.4m above sea level).",

      'With a mix of mountains and pavement, this route starts at San Augustin and goes around the goat cheese farm "üêê Queser√≠a la Gloria". The trail part starts by the end of the parking lot of Hotel Gloria Palace. Pass through the tunnel and make a sharp left after ~100 meters on a small steep trail (270m at 22% avg grade). After this hill the trail gets easier with a steady climb towards the goat farm. Take a right after passing the farm which will bring you down towards the ocean (with amazing views). After the descent simply follow the paved road back towards San Augustin.',

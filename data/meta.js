      "Not for the faint of heart! This trail combines Booleden and Värmdöleden for around 40km of (mostly) trails. Booleden (15km) starts at Boo Hembygsgård in Orminge and leads to Strömmen on the border to Värmdö, where the Värmdöleden takes over (25k). They are both marked with orange stripes on trees or poles. Do not miss the breathtaking view from Himlaberget (70.4m above sea level).",
